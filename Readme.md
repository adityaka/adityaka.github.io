#Old postings and fun facts I would like to preserve 

This section contains my old writings on the web and some the fun findings,

Most of the posts would be transferred here from the debugnotes http://debugnotes.blogspot.in/ 
and http://advinpy.blogspot.in/ 

The new ones which I would write later in leisure time
